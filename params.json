Assume it is under you home directory.\r\n$ cd ~/workspace\r\n\r\nEnter the following command (make sure you have access to the Internet):\r\n```\r\n$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=edu.stthomas.gps -DartifactId=SEIS736 \\ -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false\r\n```\r\n\r\n_(**Note:** The backslash at the end of the first line means the command is not completed, we often use it for a long command, so if you want to enter the command on two lines, use it. But if you type the command on one line, you should not type backslash.)_\r\n\r\nAfter it is done, there will be a directory called SEIS736 created under the current directory. Go into this directory:\r\n```\r\n$ cd SEIS736\r\n```\r\nEnter the following command (make sure you have access to the Internet):\r\n```\r\n$ mvn -Declipse.workspace=/home/username/workspace eclipse:configure-workspace \\ eclipse:eclipse\r\n```\r\n_(**Note:** remember to replace 'username' with your real user name)_\r\n\r\nReplace the pom.xml file (under SEIS736) with the one at the bottom of this document and enter this command (make sure you have access to the Internet):\r\n```\r\n$ mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse\r\n```\r\n### Set up M2_REPO environment variable\r\nGo to your home directory:\r\n```\r\n$ cd ~\r\n```\r\nOpen .bashrc file with a text editor, and add the following line to the end of the file, then save and quit.\r\n```\r\nexport M2_REPO=$HOME/.m2/repository\r\n```\r\nEnter the following command:\r\n```\r\n$ source .bashrc\r\n```\r\n### Import project into Eclipse\r\nStart eclipse, and select \r\n```\r\nFile->Import->Existing Projects Into Workspace\r\n```\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
