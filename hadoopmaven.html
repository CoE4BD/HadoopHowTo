#Setup Eclipse for Hadoop Development Using Maven
##Shuo Yang

###Install MavenFirst, open a shell terminal and check if Maven version 3 is already installed. 
`$ mvn -v`If it is not installed, enter the following command to install (make sure you have access to the Internet):
`$ sudo apt-get install maven`After it is completely done, type in 'mvn -v' again, you might see the following information:
`Apache Maven 3.0.4 Maven home: /usr/share/maven Java version: 1.6.0_27, vendor: Sun Microsystems Inc. Java home: /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: UTF-8 OS name: "linux", version: "3.8.0-30-generic", arch: "amd64", family: "unix" `###Install EclipseTo install Eclipse, enter the following command (make sure you have access to the Internet):
`$ sudo apt-get install eclipse`###Integrate Maven with EclipseChange your working directory to Eclipse's workspace. Assume it is under you home directory.
`$ cd ~/workspace`
Enter the following command (make sure you have access to the Internet):
`$ mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=edu.stthomas.gps -DartifactId=SEIS736 \ -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DinteractiveMode=false`
*(Note: The backslash at the end of the first line means the command is not completed, we often use it for a long command, so if you want to enter the command on two lines, use it. But if you type the command on one line, you should not type backslash.)*After it is done, there will be a directory called SEIS736 created under the current directory. Go into this directory:
`$ cd SEIS736`
Enter the following command (make sure you have access to the Internet):
`$ mvn -Declipse.workspace=/home/username/workspace eclipse:configure-workspace \ eclipse:eclipse`
*(Note: remember to replace 'username' with your real user name)*Replace the pom.xml file (under SEIS736) with the one at the bottom of this document and enter this command (make sure you have access to the Internet):
`$ mvn eclipse:clean eclipse:eclipse`###Set up M2_REPO environment variableGo to your home directory:
`$ cd ~`
Open .bashrc file with a text editor, and add the following line to the end of the file, then save and quit.
`export M2_REPO=$HOME/.m2/repository`
Enter the following command:`$ source .bashrc`###Import project into EclipseStart eclipse, and select File->Import->Existing Projects Into Workspace
